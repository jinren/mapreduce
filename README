1. Start threads with the number of parallelization. Each thread opens the file and works on specified offset.
2. Each thread starts parsing the file. For each word found, hash it to a hash value. A binary tree is built and the key for each node is the hash value. So the lookup will be based on the hash value of each word. Each node of the tree also has a linked list for hash collision, which means the different words with the same hash value will be linked with the list. The hash collision is supposed to be rare so the list is supposed to be small. Another assumption here is that the parallelization is large enough so that the tree will be able to be kept in RAM.
